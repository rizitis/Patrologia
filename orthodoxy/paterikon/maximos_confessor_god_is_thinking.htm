			οὐσία καὶ ὅλος οὐσία καὶ μόνον· καὶ ὑπὲρ οὐσίαν ὅλος καὶ ὑπὲρ νόησιν 
			ὅλος, διότι καὶ μονὰς ἀδιαίρετος καὶ ἀμερὴς καὶ ἁπλῆ. Ὁ τοίνυν καθ᾿ 
			ὁτιοῦν νόησιν ἔχων, οὔπω τῆς δυάδος ἐξῆλθεν· ὁ δὲ ταύτην πάμπαν ἀπολιπών, 
			γέγονε ποσῶς ἐν τῇ μονάδι, τὴν τοῦ νοεῖν ὑπεροχικῶς ἀποθέμενος δύναμιν.

			<h1>Maximus the Confessor: God is thinking</h1>

			<p>from Chapters on Theology (* 1.82. Translated by Elpenor)</p>

			<p>LL thinking denotes multitude or dyad at any rate, because it is 
			a relation in the middle of certain extremes, conjoining the one who 
			thinks with what is being thought. And none of them by nature saves 
			simplicity entirely, since the one who thinks is some subject, having 
			necessarily as a constituent the power of thinking. And what is being 
			thought is at any rate a subject or into a subject, having as a constituent 
			the potentiality of being thought or having underlying the essence of 
			that, of which itself is the power. There isn’t any being at all, that 
			is in itself a simple essence or mind, so that to be also indivisibly 
			one. But God, whether we may call him essence, He doesn’t have by his 
			nature as a constituent the power of being thought, because He is not 
			composite, or (if we call him) thinking, He doesn’t have by his nature 
			an underlying essence receptive of thinking. But God himself in his 
			essence is thinking, and He is thinking and only that, and himself according 
			to his thinking is essence, all of Him essence and only that, above 
			essence all of him and above thinking all of him, because He is also 
			indivisibly one, partless and simple. Therefore, whoever in whatever 
			has thinking, has not yet left the dyad, but whoever abandonded thinking 
			perfectly has become totally into the one, having left aside excellently 
			the power of thinking.</p>
