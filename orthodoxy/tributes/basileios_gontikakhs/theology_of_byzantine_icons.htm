<p>The Lord is «the unchanging icon of Being» (St John of Damaskos, canon of the 
Transfiguration). Every icon is related to but is not identical with its archetype. 
The Lord, being of one essence with the Father, is the most perfect icon that can 
exist. The creation of man in the image of God is the ground of the inner relationship 
and communion between God and man. «But because we darkened and afflicted the likeness 
of the divine image with the impurity of the passions, (He confers) a second communion... 
and the archetype mingles with the image... and is hypostatically identified with 
it» (St John of Damaskos, P.G. 96,55A). This hypostatic identification of the archetype 
(the Son of God) with the image (man) is the precondition and actuality of our salvation 
or - to put this in a different way - is the forming anew of our original state 
of beauty. In all His divinity He became perfect man and in all His humanity He 
remained perfect God. He assumed, beautified and saved the obscured image of God 
in man: it was «blended with divine beauty». And this beauty is synonymous with 
our deification and our salvation. «Because the divinity is mingled like some life-giving 
and salvatory medicine with our nature, our nature has been glorified and transformed 
into incorruption» (St John of Damaskos, P.G. 94, 1332D).</p>

<p>This truth and this fulfillment of salvation is lived by the Church as «inconceivable 
beauty» from the day of Pentecost, when «He who fulfils with more than beauty» in 
His divine economy sent down His Holy Spirit and established the Church. Yet when 
heresies began to try to adulterate this salvatory reality; when an alien spirit 
- an idolatrous mentality- began to protest and to deny the truth and grace conferred 
through Jesus Christ to understand transcendent realities in a worldly manner, things 
uncreated as though created, to deny the divinity and the humanity of the Lord, 
the God-bearing of the Virgin Mary, the divinity of the Spirit and the union of 
the two natures in Christ: then the Church reacted as one body. It convoked the 
ecumenical Councils; it formulated the articles of the faith; it expressed clearly 
and simply what it had held within it from the beginning.</p>

<p>In the iconoclastic furore, which broke out later and continued for almost a 
century and a half (726-843), the Church experienced the revival of the old heresies 
and persecutions, the frenetic and many-sided attack on its own being, the denial 
as a whole of the divine economy. But by God&#39;s grace truth triumphed. The relevant 
theology was formulated with greater clarity. The icons were restored, the Church 
clothed itself in divine beauty: «the splendour of the truest doctrines shines forth». 
And this victory is described not as the victory on behalf of the holy icons, but 
as the triumph of Orthodoxy. «For with the orthodoxy of the doctrine blending the 
brilliance of the colours and reverendly decked on all sides with holy beauty... 
it is recognized by fitting beauty» (Photios).</p>

<p>There is an affinity between truth and beauty. There is a relationship between 
theology and iconography. «For what the narrative word presents through the ear, 
the picture silently reveals in a mimetic form» (St Germanos of Constantinople, 
P.G. 98, 172C). Thus the truth that is hypostatically made incarnate through the 
holy Mother of God is formulated dogmatically by the ecumenical Councils and the 
holy Fathers; and the same truth is represented iconically by sacred iconographers. 
All this is accomplished through the power and the activity of the Holy Spirit: 
through the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, the Mother of God gives birth to the 
Theanthropos, the Lord, ground of man&#39;s deification.</p>

<p>With the illumination of the same Spirit the divinely inspired Fathers «with 
concise speech and great understanding» formulated the dogmas of the true faith 
and safeguarded the presupposition for the fulfillment of life. And with the same 
divine energy iconographers delineated the image of the figure of the Theanthropos, 
thus making the Lord&#39;s presence with us more manifest.</p>

<p>These three activities of the Holy Spirit are all different revelations of the 
incarnate Logos of God. And if a person is to participate in the grace of the incarnation 
- if he is to know the Lord, be initiated into «the mystery of theology» and to 
discern the beauty of the icon - he must be endowed with spiritual senses, share 
in the grace of the Holy Spirit that «establishes the whole order of the Church». 
It is on account of this that we are incapable of saying Lord Jesus other than in 
the Holy Spirit. And we cannot look on the icon of the Lord except through the illumination 
of the Spirit: «It is through the illumination of the Spirit that we see the radiance 
of the glory (the Son) of God, and it is through the form that is the form and exact 
image of the Father that we are led to the Father» (St Basil the Great, P.G. 39, 
185C).</p>

<p>Within the Church Christ is known not as some initiate or religious leader but 
as the Theanthropos through whom we approach the Father, the source of light. And 
theology is not a science - not even sacred science- but the «mystery» that initiates 
the whole man into what is above nature and sense. And the icon is not a simple 
work of art or a religious picture but an incommutable and sacred liturgical vessel 
that sanctifies man and brings him into immediate relationship with the grace and 
state of being of the saint it shows forth. «With respect to the archetype the icon 
abides in it, makes it visible and is venerated with it» (St Theodore Studite, P.G. 
99, 433A).</p>

<p>What is important is that we should understand how the Church, living in Christ 
Jesus, sees the theology of the saints, their holy relics, the icons and all its 
sacred vessels. They are all organically interconnected and from all of them there 
rises a universal hymn to the life-creating Trinity. This happens because everything 
depends on a life-creating centre &#8212; the Theanthropos «through whom we know the Father 
and through whom the Holy Spirit has come to dwell in the world». And He reveals 
to us through His incarnation the life hidden in the Holy Trinity («I have made 
known to you all I have heard from the Father»). He reveals to us the relationships 
between the three Persons. He gives life to all of us. He sanctifies and deifies 
our nature, soul and body. He unites us to each other. He reveals to us that we 
are one body and one spirit and He gives us the strength to bring this into effect. 
Because He Himself discloses to us, as the precise icon of the Father and as the 
stamp of His Person, the single and unique relationship He has with God the Father 
and with the Holy Spirit. And he who has seen the Lord has seen the Father through 
the Holy Spirit. «Thus the road to divine knowledge passes from the one Spirit through 
the one Son to the one Father. And conversely natural goodness and sanctification 
according to nature and the royal dignity come from the Father, through the only-begotten 
Son to the Spirit» (St Basil the Great, P.G. 32, 153B-C).</p>

<p>The Orthodox liturgical icon is the irradiation of the life and faith of the 
Church that is itself the body of Christ and the communion of the Holy Spirit. It 
is the manifestation of the new mode of life and grace. And through the icons the 
believer receives the divine favour and through them his mind is raised up to the 
heavens.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that while the iconoclasts smash the icons and so in effect 
deny the incarnation of the Logos; while the icon-idolizers worship the material 
aspects of the icon and so lose sight of God; while in the West the icon is regarded 
as a decorative element (decision of the Council of Frankfurt, 794), the Orthodox 
Church remains faithful to the incarnate Logos of God and rejects all these erroneous 
attitudes. It does not reject matter like the dualists, but neither does it worship 
it as the pagans or regard it as without theological significance; but it confesses 
its faith through the mouth of St John of Damaskos: I worship the God who has saved 
me, who became material for my sake. And I do not cease to venerate the matter through 
which I have been saved and which is filled with divine grace.</p>

<p>The flesh assumed by Christ has been deified. In the transfiguration of the Lord, 
when He conferred on His disciples the capacity to perceive a ray of His divinity, 
His face shone with the pre-eternal glory that He possessed with God before the 
existence of the world. And it was revealed that with the incarnation the glory 
of the divinity became the glory and beauty of the body, the glory and beauty of 
creation Matter is full of divine grace. It is for this reason, continues the Saint 
that I move with reverence in the created world, seeing it illumined with the light 
of the resurrected Christ which fills sky, earth and what is below the earth. «I 
venerate every holy temple of God and everything in which God is affirmed not on 
account of its own nature but because it is the receptacle of divine energy» (St 
John of Damaskos, P.G. 94, 1353B).</p>

<p>In the icon of Christ we confront neither the invisible and unimaginable divinity 
(who can circumscribe the uncircumscribable?) nor simply the humanity alone (how 
can one separate out the humanity in Him who in His Person indivisibly and unconfusedly 
united the divine and human nature?). In the icon is shown forth - is imaged -the 
single hypostasis of the incarnate Logos of God. And in venerating the icon we venerate 
the Theanthropos, the divinity and the humanity, the flesh of the Lord that has 
become one with God. «It is not the nature, but the hypostasis of the person portrayed 
that is shown forth in the icon» (St Theodore Studite, P.G. 99,405A). For this reason 
there are not two acts of veneration, but one, offered to the hypostatic unity: 
«A single act of veneration, not distinguished according to the distinction of the 
essence but on the contrary identified according to the unity of the single hypostasis» 
(St Theodore Studite, P.G. 99, 497B-C).</p>

<p>The icon does not merely assist the memory in recreating events and people that 
belong to the past, but it creates and imposes a sense of presence. It brings the 
believer into personal relationship and contact with the saint who is portrayed. 
He does not stand before materials &#8212; wood, stone, shapes, colours &#8212; bereft of the 
«informing and coexisting power and grace» but before «what has been made holy, 
precious, glorified and sacred through participation in the celestial energy» of 
the saint whose person the icon shows forth and whose name it bears (The «Amphilochia» 
of Photios).</p>

<p>The icon is voiceless yet speaks. You have before you the person iconized. You 
unite with him. You discover him, you encounter him, you greet him with the lips, 
with the eyes, with the heart «icons... should... be venerated and kissed with eyes, 
lips and heart» (St John of Damaskos, P.G. 94, 1332B).</p>

<p>The sanctification and the succour fill the whole of man&#39;s existence. And the 
confession, the manifestation and portrayal of the Lord is achieved with the whole 
life of the faithful. «Eternal be the memory of those who confess the incarnate 
presence of the Logos of God with speech, mouth, heart and intellect, in writing 
and in icons» (Synodikon of Orthodoxy).</p>

<p>A true fellowship and commixture of life between God and men is consummated spiritually 
in the Church, in the person of Jesus. He comes. He manifests Himself. He abides 
with us. He blesses us. He sanctifies us, soul and body. He permits us to venerate 
Him, to love Him, to receive Him within ourselves. He is the vine and we are the 
vine-branches. Through grace we become like Him, although we bear a body and live 
in time.</p>

<p>It is He who gives us the capacity to paint icons, to theologize, to build churches, 
to make all the sacred vessels, to celebrate the liturgy, to live. And while we 
do all these things, it is He who works all things in all people. It is He who celebrates 
the liturgy. It is He who illumines the theologians. He is our sanctification, the 
way, the door, the passover to life and to the fulfillment of life. It is this that 
the Church has lived from the beginning. So too did the Fathers of the 7th Ecumenical 
Council live it. They were aware that the Church is Christ Himself. It is for this 
reason that they believed and confessed that the victory over the iconoclasts was 
not the temporary victory of human opinions, nor the result of the good-will of 
emperors or of the collective agreement of councils; it was the consequence and 
disclosure of the presence of the Lord Himself, who saves the Church and every believer, 
«as the prophet said: not ambassador, nor angel, but the Lord Himself saved us. 
Following him and endorsing his voice we proclaim aloud: not council nor the might 
of emperor but the incarnate God, the Lord of glory, saved us and delivered us from 
the idolatrous deceit. Thus to Him the glory, to Him the grace, to Him the praise...» 
(Proceedings of the 7th Ecumenical Council).</p>

<p>Within that grace and glory the faithful live in Christ, without idols or deceits. 
And as the disciples saw the Lord&#39;s glory «in so far as they could», so all the 
faithful see and receive according to their capacity. All are transfigured according 
to their humility and to how much they offer themselves. All are blessed. All together 
«proclaim Christ our true God and His saints, honouring them in words, in writings, 
in thoughts, in sacrifices, in churches, in icons» (Synodikon of Orthodoxy). All 
become the occasion of theophany and all are assisted and all assist all. You cannot 
paint icons, you cannot theologize or live, you cannot be sanctified unless it is 
«with all the saints» (confessors, ascetics, martyrs, holy men, the righteous...) 
who constitute the body of the Church, the body of Christ, the true body of all 
of us. Thus the true icon-painter, being a living member of the Church, is nourished 
by all: theologians, hymnographers, the simple faithful in whose heart, mind, soul 
and body Christ the God dwells. And they are God-bearing, pure images of the Archetype. 
The icon of the holy iconographer radiates, transfuses the grace that it has received 
from the Church. It encourages the believer, illumines the theologian, inspires 
the melodist, companions the afflicted. It sanctifies the soul and body of the whole 
world. All is an icon, a melody, a theanthropic equilibrium.</p>

<p>Uncreated and deifying grace filled the soul, mind, heart and body of the saints 
while they were living. It united itself indivisibly and unconfusedly with their 
whole existence. It did not abandon them either when they rejoiced or when they 
were sad, whether they were free or in slavery, either when they lived in the flesh 
or had gone to their rest. «The grace of the Holy Spirit dwells inseparably in their 
souls and bodies, in their tombs, engravings and their holy icons, not according 
to essence, but ac-cording to grace and energy» (St John of Damaskos, P.G. 94,1249C-D). 
It is for this reason that whether they are present or absent they pour forth the 
same encouragement and possess the same fulness.</p>

<p>Through this life which is beyond life and through this grace that deifies they 
transcend divisions, they dwell with us. This uncreated energy is their life and 
their consciousness. By its means they see the beauty of what is invisible and the 
comeliness of created things. With this life in grace they behold Christ Himself: 
«The world sees Me no more, but you see Me, because I live and you will live» (John 
14: 19).</p>

<p>This same grace has sanctified the works of their hands and their minds. And 
so while the idols of the pagans are silver and gold, works of human hands - icons, 
sacred vessels, churches - are and are called «not made by hand», fashioned by God 
and built by God. For even if they are made of earthly materials, even if they have 
been wrought by the hands of men, they are holy and sacred. Their construction is 
not due to human invention, it is a spiritual service, the work of the Holy Spirit. 
They are «what is accomplished through the activity of the flesh by divine energy&#8221;.</p>

<p>There is an inspired apostolic and patristic tradition that shapes matter ma 
divine way and turns it into icons. Those reborn of water and the spirit create, 
shape, chant. Through their hands the church is built, tesserae are set in place, 
the wall-paintings are painted. «The Logos having dwelt among us according to he 
flesh...we beheld the brilliance of the glory that the Son possessed from the Father...we 
who have received Him ...having grown according to the Holy Spirit, have set up 
a house of prayer and we cry aloud: consolidate this house, Lord» (Kontakion for 
the inauguration of a church, Great Euchologion).</p>

<p>Thus the admonitions, «Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any 
likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath» 
(Exod. 20:4), and, «Do not confine God with corporeal conceptions, do not circumscribe 
Him with your mind. He is incomprehensible in His majesty» (St Gregory of Nyssa, 
P.G. 44, 261B), are wholly in accord with the words of St John of Damaskos: «Write 
of His ineffable incarnation, of His birth from a Virgin... Set down everything 
in word and colour. Do not fear, do not tremble. I recognize the distinction of 
acts of veneration ... (P.G. 94, 1240A-B).</p>

<p>And this happens in the Church, because the iconographer does not improvise individually, 
nor does he idolize his own inspirations, but he submits to the exhortations and 
the wishes of the consecrating Spirit. Christ does everything through the grace 
of the Holy Spirit. As the priest celebrates the liturgy, so do the true theologian 
and the true iconographer create, exercise their sacred art and service. They become 
instruments, lyres of the Spirit. They advance from learning and energizing to suffering 
and upholding the divine. And in that state of spiritual maturity, surrendered totally 
to the divine will, they feel that Another acts, energizes and is made manifest 
through them. It is for this reason that icons are either unsigned or they bear 
the inscription: «through the hand of&#8230;»</p>
