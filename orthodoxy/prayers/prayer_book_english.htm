			<h1><a name="Prologue"></a>PROLOGUE</h1>

			<p>Prayer, according to St. John Chrysostomos, is a large and almighty 
			weapon, a great possession, an insurance to the coming together of man 
			with God, it is a medicine, an neverending richness, the veins of the 
			soul in which the grace of God flows freely through, an invitation to 
			the eternal life. Prayer makes man alike with the Angels. Man, himself, 
			in conver-sation with God.</p>

			<p>“Nothing has it’s measure”. Nothing can compare with it, writes the 
			holy Father.</p>

			<p>Prayer is a skill thus it requires practice and continued effort. 
			It must be made with a zealous soul, with deep concen-tration, so we 
			realize what exactly we are doing, who we are standing in front of and 
			of course who are we in conversation with.</p>

			<p>“Pray without ceasing” St. Paul tells us. (1 Thess. 5. V. 17) In 
			joy, in sorrow, with patience and endurance and along with contrition 
			and humility.</p>

			<h1><a name="morning_prayers"></a>MORNING PRAYERS</h1>

			<p><font color="#cc0000">(After rising from sleep, stand with 
			reverence and fear of God, make the sign of the cross, and say:)</font></p>

			<p>In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

			<p>Glory to you, our God, glory to you.</p>

			<p>Heavenly King, comforter, the Spirit of truth, who are present everywhere 
			filling all things, Treasury of good things and Giver of life, come 
			and dwell in us, Cleanse us of every stain, and save our souls, gracious 
			Lord.</p>

			<p>Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us
			<font color="#cc0000">(3)</font>.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever 
			and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>All holy Trinity, have mercy on us, Lord, forgive us our sins. Master, 
			pardon our transgressions. Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities 
			for your name’s sake.</p>

			<p>Lord have mercy <font color="#cc0000">(3)</font>, Glory to the Father 
			and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of 
			ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>Our Father who art in heaven.<br>
			Hallowed be thy name.<br>
			Your kingdom come,<br>
			Your will be done,<br>
			on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
			Give us this day our daily bread,<br>
			And forgive us our trespasses,<br>
			As we forgive those who trespass against us.<br>
			And lead us not into temptation,<br>
			But deliver us from evil.</p>

			<p>For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, of the Father 
			and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of 
			ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>Having risen from sleep, we fall down before you. O good One, and 
			sing to you, mighty One, the angelic hymn: Holy, holy, holy art thou, 
			O God. Through the prayers of the Theotokos, have mercy on us.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>

			<p>Having aroused me from sleep and bed, O Lord, enlighten my mind and 
			open my heart and lips that I may sing to you, Holy, holy, holy, art 
			thou, O God. Through the prayers of the Theotokos, have mercy on us. 
			Now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>Suddenly the judge will come and everyone’s deeds will be revealed. 
			But with awe we cry out in the middle of the night: Holy, holy, holy 
			art thou, o God, through the prayers of the Theotokos, have mercy on 
			us.</p>

			<p>Lord have mercy <font color="#cc0000">(12)</font></p>

			<h2>THANKSGIVING PRAYER</h2>

			<p>As I rise from sleep, I thank you, Holy Trinity, for because of your 
			great goodness and patience, you were not angry with me, an idler and 
			sinner, nor have you destroyed me in my sins, but have shown your usual 
			love for me. And when I was prostrate in despair, you raised me to glorify 
			with your power. Enlighten now my mind’s eye, open my mouth to study 
			your words and understand your commandments, to do your will and sing 
			to you in heartfelt adoration, and praise your most holy name, of the 
			Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages 
			of ages. Amen.</p>

			<h2>ANOTHER PRAYER</h2>

			<p>Glory to you, King, God almig-hty, who through your divine and loving 
			providence have consented that I, an un-worthy sinner, should rise from 
			sleep and obtain entrance into your holy house. Accept, Lord, the voice 
			of my prayer as you accept those of your holy and spiritual powers. 
			And that not through my defiled lips, but from a pure heart and humble 
			spirit. Praise may be offered to you so that I also, with the bright 
			lamp of my soul, may become a companion of the wise virgins and glorify 
			you, God the Word, who is glorified in the Father and the Spirit. Amen.</p>

			<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before our King and God.</p>

			<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ, our King and God.</p>

			<p>Come, let us worship and fall down before Christ himself, our King 
			and our God.</p>

			<h2>PSALM 50 (51)</h2>

			<p>Have mercy upon me, O God according to your great mercy, and accor-ding 
			to the multitude of your compas-sion blot out my transgression.</p>

			<p>Wash me thoroughly from my sin. For I acknowledge my iniquity, and 
			my sin is ever before me.</p>

			<p>Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done evil in your sight, 
			that you may be found just when you speak, and victorious when you are 
			judged.</p>

			<p>For behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin mother bore me.</p>

			<p>For behold, you have loved truth, you have made known to me the secret 
			and hidden things of your wisdom.</p>

			<p>You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean, you 
			shall wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>

			<p>Make me to hear joy and gladness that the afflicted bones may rejoice.</p>

			<p>Turn your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

			<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within 
			me.</p>

			<p>Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit 
			from me.</p>

			<p>Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your 
			governing Spirit.</p>

			<p>I shall teach transgressors your ways, and the ungodly shall turn 
			back to you.</p>

			<p>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation, 
			my tongue shall joyfully declare your righteousness.</p>

			<p>Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare your praise,</p>

			<p>For if you had desired sacrifice, I would give it, you do not delight 
			in burnt offerings.</p>

			<p>A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit,</p>

			<p>God will not despise a broken and a humble heart.</p>

			<p>Do well in your good pleasure to Zion and let the walls of Jerusalem 
			be built.</p>

			<p>Then you shall be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with 
			oblation and whole burnt offerings.</p>

			<p>Then they shall offer bulls on your altar.</p>

			<h2>THE SYMBOL OF FAITH</h2>

			<p>I believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, creator of heaven 
			and earth and all things visible and invisible.</p>

			<p>And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, begotten 
			of the Father before all ages.</p>

			<p>Light of Light, true God of true God, begotten, not created, of one 
			essence with the Father, through whom all things were made.</p>

			<p>For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven and was incarnate 
			by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.</p>

			<p>He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was 
			buried.</p>

			<p>On the third day he rose according to the Scriptures. He ascended 
			into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p>

			<p>He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.</p>

			<p>His kingdom will have no end.</p>

			<p>And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord the Giver of life, who proceeds 
			from the Father, who together with the Father and the Son is worshiped 
			and glorified, who spoke through the prophets.</p>

			<p>In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.</p>

			<p>I acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.</p>

			<p>I expect the resurrection of the dead.</p>

			<p>And the life of the age to come. Amen.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit. Now and 
			forever and to the ages of ages. Amen. Lord have mercy
			<font color="#cc0000">(3)</font></p>

			<p>Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, Lord Jesus Christ, have 
			mercy on us, and save us. Amen.</p>

			<p>ATTENTION, (many Christians have the blessed habit of reading the 
			SIX PSALMS and the small DOXOLOGY, in their morning praise to God.)</p>

			one, our supplications.</p>

			<p>Most praised Theotokos, establish the Orthodox people, save those 
			whom you have called to govern and grant them victory from above, for 
			you have given birth to God, only blessed one.</p>

			<h2>PSALM 3.</h2>

			<p>Lord, why have they multiplied who afflict me?</p>

			<p>Many rise up against me. Many say to my soul there is no salvation 
			for him in his God. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the 
			one who lifts up my head. I cried to the Lord with my voice, and he 
			heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept, I awoke, for 
			the Lord will help me. I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people 
			who have set themselves against me all around.</p>

			<p>Arise, Lord, save me, my God. For you have struck all those who without 
			cause are my enemies, you have broken the teeth of sinners. Salvation 
			belongs to the Lord, and your blessing is upon your people.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>PSALM 37(38)</h2>

			<p>Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor chasten me in your wrath. 
			For your arrows pierce me deeply, and your hand presses me down. There 
			is no health in my flesh because of your anger, nor is there any health 
			in my bones because of my sins. For my iniquities have risen higher 
			than my head, like a heavy burden they have pressed heavily upon me. 
			My wounds are foul and festering because of my foolishness. I am troubled 
			bowed down greatly, I go mourning all the day long.</p>

			<p>For my loins are filled with mockings, and there is no healing in 
			my flesh. I am afflicted and exceedingly humbled, I have roared from 
			the groaning of my heart.</p>

			<p>Lord, all my desire is before you; and my sighing is not hidden from 
			you.</p>

			<p>My heart is troubled, and my strength has failed me; and the light 
			of my eyes, it also has gone from me. My friends and neighbours drew 
			near me and stood against me. And my kinsmen stood afar off.</p>

			<p>Those who sought my soul used violence; those who sought evil for 
			me spoke vain things and meditated eception all day long. But I became 
			like a deaf man who does not hear; and I am like a mute who does not 
			open his mouth.</p>

			<p>Thus I am like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth there 
			is no response. For in you, Lord have I hope, you will hear me, Lord 
			my God. For I said, never let my enemies rejoice over me, and when my 
			feet are shaken, they magnify themselves against me. For I am ready 
			for scourges, and my sorrow is continually before me. For I will declare 
			my iniquity, and I will be in anguish over my sin. But my enemies live 
			and become stronger than me, and those who hate me unjustly have multiplied.</p>

			<p>Those who render evil for good slandered me because I pursued goodness. 
			Do not forsake me, Lord, my God, be not far from me.</p>

			<p>Make haste to help me, Lord of my salvation.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>PSALM 62(63)</h2>

			<p>God, my God, early at dawn I rise to you. My soul thirsts for you, 
			my flesh longs for you in a barren, untrodden and unwatered land. So 
			I have appeared be-fore you in the sanctuary to see your po-wer and 
			your glory. For your mercy is better than life, my lips shall praise 
			you. Thus I shall bless you while I live, and I will lift up my hands 
			in your name. Let my soul be filled with marrow and plentiness, and 
			my mouth shall praise you with joyful lips. When I remember you on my 
			bed, I meditate on you at dawn.</p>

			<p>For you have become my helper, I shall rejoice in the shelter of 
			your wings.</p>

			<p>My soul follows close behind you, your right hand has been quick 
			to help me. But those who seek my life, to destroy it, shall go into 
			the lower parts of the earth. They shall fall by the sword, they shall 
			be a portion for jackals. But the king shall rejoice in God, everyone 
			who swears by him shall be praised, but the mouths of those who speak 
			lies shall be stopped.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever 
			and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Glory be to God
			<font color="#cc0000">(3 times)</font>, Lord have mercy
			<font color="#cc0000">(3)</font>, Glory to the Father and the Son and 
			the Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of ages. Amen</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>PSALM 87(88)</h2>

			<p>Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried out day and night before 
			you. Let my prayer come before you, incline your ear to my cry. For 
			my soul is filled with evil and my life draws near to Hades. I am counted 
			with those who go down to the pit, I am like a man without help, adrift 
			among the dead. Like the bodies of the slain who sleep in the grave, 
			whom you remember no more, and who are cut off from your hand. They 
			have laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, and the shadow of death. 
			Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you have afflicted me with all your 
			waves. You have made me an abomination to them, I am shut up, and I 
			cannot get out, my eyes have grown weak from poverty. I have cried to 
			you, Lord, the entire day. I have stretched out my hands to you. Will 
			you work wonders for the dead?</p>

			<p>Or shall physicians raise them up so that they might thank you?</p>

			<p>Shall any in the grave speak of your mercy and your truth in the 
			place of destruction?</p>

			<p>Shall your wonders be known in the dark, and your righteousness in 
			the land of forgetfulness?</p>

			<p>But as for me, I have cried out to you, Lord and in the morning my 
			prayer shall come before you. Lord, why do you cast off my soul, and 
			turn away from me?</p>

			<p>I am a poor man and in trouble. From my youth, having been exalted, 
			I was hum-bled and brought to distress. Your fierce wrath has gone over 
			me, and your terrors have sorely troubled me.</p>

			<p>They came around me all day long like water, they engulfed me altogether. 
			You have put far away from me my friend and neighbour, and my acquain-tances 
			because of my misery.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>PSALM 102(103)</h2>

			<p>Bless the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy 
			name!</p>

			<p>Bless the Lord, my soul, and forget not all that he has done for 
			you. He forgives all your iniquities.</p>

			<p>He heals all your infirmities. He redeems your life from corruption. 
			He crowns you with mercy and compassion. He satisfies your desire with 
			good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagles’. The Lord 
			performs deeds of mercy, and justice for all who are wronged.</p>

			<p>He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel. 
			The Lord is merciful and compassionate, slow to manger, and abounding 
			in mercy. He will not always strive with us, nor will he keep his anger 
			forever. He has dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor has he 
			rewarded us according to our sins.</p>

			<p>For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his mercy 
			towards those who fear him.</p>

			<p>As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our iniquities 
			from us. As a father has compassion upon his son, so has the Lord compassion 
			upon those who fear him.</p>

			<p>For he knows what we are made of, he remembers that we are dust. 
			As for man, his days are like grass, as a flower of the field, so shall 
			he blossom. For the wind passes over it, then it shall be gone. And 
			its place remembers it no more.</p>

			<p>But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity to eternity upon those 
			who fear him, and his righteousness is upon sons of sons, upon those 
			who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. The Lord 
			has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.</p>

			<p>Bless the Lord all his angels, who excel in strength, who do his 
			word, heeding the voice of his word.</p>

			<p>Bless the Lord, all you his hosts, you ministers of his, who do his 
			pleasure.</p>

			<p>Bless the Lord, all his works, in all places of his dominion.</p>

			<p>Bless the Lord, my soul.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>PSALM 142(143)</h2>

			<p>Lord hear my prayer. In your truth, give ear to my supplications, 
			in your righteousness, hear me.</p>

			<p>And enter not into judgement with your servant, for no one living 
			is justified in your sight.</p>

			<p>For the enemy has pursued my soul, he has crushed my life to the 
			ground, he has made me dwell in darkness, like those who have long been 
			dead, and my spirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within me is 
			distressed. I remembered the days of old, I meditated on your works, 
			I pondered on the work of your hands.</p>

			<p>I spread out my hands to you, my soul longs for you like a thirsty 
			land. Lord, hear me quickly, my spirit fails.</p>

			<p>Turn not your face away from me, lest I be like those who go down 
			into the pit. Let me hear your mercy in the morning, for in you I have 
			put my trust. Lord, teach me to know the way in which I should walk, 
			for I lift up my soul to you. Rescue me, Lord, from my enemies, to you 
			have I fled for refuge. Teach me to do your will, for you are my god. 
			Your good Spirit shall lead me on a level path, Lord, for your name’s 
			sake you shall preserve my life. In your righteousness, you shall bring 
			my soul out of trouble, and in your mercy, you shall utterly destroy 
			my enemies. And you shall destroy all those who afflict my soul, for 
			I am your servant.</p>

			<p>Hear me, Lord, in your righteousness, and enter not into judgement 
			with your servant (2).</p>

			<p>Your good Spirit shall lead me on a level path.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and 
			forever and to the ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. 
			Glory to you, our God (3 times). Lord, you are our hope, glory to you. 
			Amen.</p>

			exceedingly.</p>

			<p>Confession and majesty hast Thou put on,</p>

			<p>Who coverest Thyself with light as with a garment,</p>

			<p>Who stretchest out the heaven as it were a curtain, Who supporteth 
			His chambers in the waters,</p>

			<p>Who appointeth the clouds for His ascent,</p>

			<p>Who walketh upon the wings of the winds,</p>

			<p>Who maketh His angels’ spirits and His ministers a flame of fire,</p>

			<p>Who establisheth the earth in the sureness thereof, it shall not 
			be turned back forever and ever.</p>

			<p>The abyss like a garment is His mantle; upon the mountains shall 
			the waters stand.</p>

			<p>At Thy rebuke they will flee, at the voice of Thy thunder shall they 
			be afraid.</p>

			<p>The mountains rise up and the plains sink down, unto the place where 
			Thou hast established them.</p>

			<p>Thou appointed a bound that they shall not pass, neither return to 
			cover the earth.</p>

			<p>He sendth forth springs in the valleys; between the mountains will 
			the waters run.</p>

			<p>They shall give drink to all the beasts of the field, the wild asses 
			will wait to quench their thirst.</p>

			<p>Besides them will the birds of the heaven lodge, from the midst of 
			the rocks will they give voice.</p>

			<p>He watereth the mountains from His chambers, the earth shall be satisfied 
			with the fruit of Thy works.</p>

			<p>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and green herb for the 
			service of men,</p>

			<p>To bring forth bread out of the earth, and wine maketh glad the heart 
			of man.</p>

			<p>To make his face cheerful with oil, and bread strengtheth man’s heart.</p>

			<p>The trees of the plain shall be satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon, 
			which thou hast planted.</p>

			<p>There will the sparrows make their nests; the house of the heron 
			is chief among them.</p>

			<p>The high mountains are a refuge for the harts, and so is the rock 
			for the hares.</p>

			<p>He hath made the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down.</p>

			<p>Thou appointedst the darkness, and there was night, wherein all the 
			beasts of the forest will go abroad.</p>

			<p>Young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their food from 
			God.</p>

			<p>The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together, and they lay them 
			down in their dens.</p>

			<p>But man shall go forth unto his work, and to his labour until the 
			evening.</p>

			<p>How magnified are Thy works, o Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them 
			all, the earth is filled with Thy creation.</p>

			<p>So is the great and spacious sea, therein are things creeping innumerable, 
			small living creatures with the great.</p>

			<p>There go the ships, there this dragon, whom Thou hast made to play 
			therein.</p>

			<p>All things wait on Thee, to give them their food in due season, when 
			thou givest it them, they will gather it.</p>

			<p>When Thou openest Thy hand, all things shall be filled with goodness, 
			when Thou turnest away Thy face, they shall be troubled.</p>

			<p>Thou wilt take their spirit, and they shall cease, and unto their 
			dust shall they return.</p>

			<p>Thou wilt send forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and shalt 
			renew the face of the earth.</p>

			<p>Let the glory of the Lord be unto the ages, the Lord will rejoice 
			in His works,</p>

			<p>Who looketh on the earth and maketh it tremble, who toucheth the 
			mountains and they smoke.</p>

			<p>I will sing unto the Lord throughout my life, I will chant to my 
			God as long as I exist.</p>

			<p>May my words be sweet unto him, and I will rejoice in the Lord.</p>

			<p>That sinners would cease from the earth, and they that work iniquity, 
			that they should be no more. Bless the Lord, o my soul.</p>

			<p>The sun knoweth his going down, Thou appointedst the darkness, and 
			there was the night.</p>

			<p>How magnified are Thy works, o Lord! In wisdom hast Thou made them 
			all.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, both now 
			and forever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia. Glory to Thee, O God

			<h2>Psalm 140(141)</h2>

			<p>Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hearken unto me, hearken unto me, O 
			Lord. Lord, I have cried unto Thee, hearken unto me, attend to the voice 
			of my supplication when I cry unto Thee: Hearken unto me, o Lord.</p>

			<p>Set, o Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of enclosure round 
			about my lips.</p>

			<p>Incline not my heart unto words of evil, to make excuse with excuses 
			in sins.</p>

			<p>With men that work iniquity, and I will not join with their chosen.</p>

			<p>The righteous man will chasten me with mercy and reprove me, as for 
			the oil of the sinner, let it not anoint my head.</p>

			<p>For yet more is my prayer in the presence of their pleasures, swallowed 
			up near by the rock have their judges been.</p>

			<p>They shall hear my words, for they be sweetened, as a clod of earth 
			is broken upon the earth, so have their bones been scattered nigh unto 
			Hades.</p>

			<p>For unto Thee, o Lord O Lord, are mine eyes, In Thee have I hoped, 
			take not my soul away.</p>

			<p>Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the 
			stumbling blocks of them that work iniquity.</p>

			<p>The sinners shall fall into their own net; I am alone until I pass 
			by.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>Psalm 141(142)</h2>

			<p>With my voice unto the Lord have I cried with my voice unto the Lord 
			have I made supplication.</p>

			<p>I will pour out before Him my supplication, mine affliction before 
			him will I declare.</p>

			<p>When my spirit was fainting within me, then Thou knewest my paths.</p>

			<p>In this way wherein I have walked they hid for me a snare.</p>

			<p>I looked upon my right hand, and beheld, and there was none that 
			did know me.</p>

			<p>Flight hath failed me, and there is none that watcheth out for my 
			soul.</p>

			<p>I have cried unto Thee, o Lord, I said: Thou art my hope, my portion 
			art Thou in the land of the living.</p>

			<p>Attend unto my supplication, for I am brought very low.</p>

			<p>Deliver me from them that persecute me, for they are stronger than 
			I am.</p>

			<p>The righteous shall wait patiently for me until Thou shalt reward 
			me.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>Psalm 129 (130)</h2>

			<p>Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O, Lord, O Lord, hear my 
			voice.</p>

			<p>Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.</p>

			<p>If Thou shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, o Lord, who shall stand? 
			For with Thee there is forgiveness.</p>

			<p>For Thy Name’s sake have I patiently waited for Thee, o Lord, my 
			soul hath waited patiently for Thy word, my soul hath hoped in the Lord.</p>

			<p>From the morning watch until night, from the morning watch let Israel 
			hope in the Lord.</p>

			<p>For with the Lord there is mercy, and with Him is plenteous redemption, 
			and He shall redeem Israel out of all his iniquities.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>Psalm 116 (117)</h2>

			<p>Praise the Lord, all ye nations, praise Him, all ye peoples.</p>

			<p>For He hath made His mercy to prevail over us, and the truth of the 
			Lord abideth forever.</p>

			<h2>Psalm 50 (51).</h2>

			<p>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to your great mercy, and according 
			to the multitude of your compassion, blot out my transgression.</p>

			<p>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
			For I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.</p>

			<p>Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done evil in your sight, 
			that you may be found just when you speak, and victorious when you are 
			judged.</p>

			<p>For behold, I was conceived in iniquity, and in sin my mother bore 
			me.</p>

			<p>For behold, you have loved truth, you have made known to me the secret 
			and hidden things of your wisdom.</p>

			<p>You shall sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean, you 
			shall wash me, and I shall whiter than snow.</p>

			<p>Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the afflicted bones may rejoice.</p>

			<p>Turn your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

			<p>Create in me a clean heart, o God, and renew a steadfast spirit within 
			me.</p>

			<p>Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit 
			from me.</p>

			<p>Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and establish me with your 
			governing Spirit.</p>

			<p>I shall teach transgressors your ways, and the ungodly shall turn 
			back to you.</p>

			<p>Deliver me from bloodguitiness, o God, the God of my salvation, my 
			tongue shall joyfully declare your righteousness.</p>

			<p>Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall declare your praise.</p>

			<p>For if you had desired sacrifice, I would give it, you do not delight 
			in burnt offerings. A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit, God will 
			not despise a broken and a humble heart.</p>

			<p>Do good in your good pleasure to Zion, and let not Jerusalem be built.</p>

			<p>Then you shall be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with 
			oblation and whole burnt offerings. Then they shall offer bulls on your 
			altar.</p>

			<h2>Psalm 69 (70)</h2>

			<p>Let them be turn back because of their shame, who say to me, Well 
			done! Well done!</p>

			<p>Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you, and let those 
			who love your salvation say continually, Let God be magnified! But as 
			for me, I am poor and needy, O god, help me!</p>

			<p>You are my help and my deliverer,</p>

			<h2>Psalm 142 (143)</h2>

			<p>Lord hear my prayer. In your truth, give ear to my supplications, 
			in your righteousness, hear me. Enter not into judgement with your servant, 
			for no one living is justified in your sight.</p>

			<p>For the enemy has pursued my soul, he has crushed my life to the 
			ground, he has made me dwell in darkness, like those who have long been 
			dead, and my spirit is overwhelmed within me, my heart within is distressed.</p>

			<p>I remembered the days of old, I meditated on the works, I pondered 
			on the works of your hands.</p>

			<p>I spread out my hands to you, my soul longs for you like a thirsty 
			land. Lord, hear me quickly, my spirit fails. Turn not your face away 
			from me, lest I be like those who go down into the pit.</p>

			<p>Let me hear your mercy in the morning, for in you I have put my trust. 
			Lord, teach me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up 
			my soul to you.</p>

			<p>Rescue me, Lord, from my enemies, to you have I fled for refuge.</p>

			<p>Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.</p>

			<p>Your good Spirit shall lead me on a level path, Lord, for your name’s 
			sake you shall preserve my life. In your righteousness, you shall bring 
			my soul out of trouble, and in your mercy, you shall utterly destroy 
			my enemies. And you shall destroy all those who afflict my soul, for 
			I am your servant.</p>

			You are the only hope of the hopeless, and the help of those oppressed.</p>

			<p>You are the ready protection of those who flee to you and the refuge 
			of all Christians. Do not spurn me an accused sinner, though I have 
			made myself completely useless by my shameful thoughts, words, and deeds 
			and through indolence have become a slave to the pleasures of life. 
			But as the Mother of God who loves all people, mercifully have compassion 
			upon me a sinner and a prodigal and receive my prayer though it be offered 
			to you by unclean lips. Entreat your Son and our Lord and Master, using 
			your boldness as a mother, so that he may open to me the loving mercy 
			of his goodness, overlook my numberless transgressions, turn me to repentance, 
			and make me an acceptable abider of his commandments. Always be near 
			to me, for you are merciful, compassionate, and loving. Be my ardent 
			help and protection in this present life, defending me from the assaults 
			of adversaries, and lead me to salvation. At the hour of my death, care 
			for my miserable soul and drive the dark visions of the evil spirits 
			far from it. On the awesome day of judgement, save me from eternal punishment 
			and make me an inheritor of the ineffable glory of your Son, our God.</p>

			<p>May this be my lot, my Lady, all holy Theotokos, through your intercession

			<h2>Prayer to our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
			<i>Prayer by Antiochos, a monk of Pandectis.</i></h2>

			<p>Grant us, Master, as we depart for sleep, rest for body and soul. 
			Protect us from the gloom of sinful sleep and from all dark pleasures 
			of the night. Calm the impulses of passion, and quench the fiery darts 
			of evil which are treacherously cast against us. Check the turbulence 
			of our flesh and lull all our earthly and mundane thoughts. Grant us, 
			O God, a watchful mind, prudent reason, a vigilant heart, and tranquail 
			sleep, free from all evil dreams. Raise us up at the hour of prayer, 
			strengthen us in your commandments, and keep unshaken within us the 
			remembrance of your judgements. Grant us to glorify you all night long 
			that we may praise and bless and glorify your all-honorable and magnificent 
			name, of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and forever 
			and to the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p>Most glorious, ever virgin, blessed Theotokos, present our prayers 
			to your Son and our God, and plead with him, that through you he may 
			save our souls.</p>

			<p>My hope is the Father, my refuge, the Son, my protection, the Holy 
			Spirit. Holy Trinity, glory to you.</p>

			<p>My every hope I place in you, Mother of God, keep me under your protection.</p>

			<p>Because of you. O full of grace, all creation rejoices, the ranks 
			of the Angels and the human race. Hallowed Temple and spiritual Paradise, 
			pride of Virgins, from you God became flesh and he, who is our God before 
			the ages, became a little child.</p>

			<p>For he made your womb a throne and caused it to become wider than 
			the heavens. Because of you, O full of grace, all creation rejoices, 
			glory to you.</p>

			<p>Holy angel, attendant of my wretched soul and miserable life, do 
			not abandon me a sinner, neither desert me because of my incontinency.</p>

			<p>Give no place to the evil demon to subdue me with the oppression 
			of this mortal body, but take me by my wretched and outstretched hand, 
			and lead me in the way of salvation. Yes, Holy Angel of God, the guardian 
			and protector of my hapless soul and body, forgive me all things whatsoever 
			wherewith I have troubled you, all the days of my life, and if I have 
			sinned in anything this day. Shelter me in this present night, and keep 
			me from every abuse of the adversary, that I may not anger God by any 
			sin, and intercede with the Lord in my behalf, that he might strengthen 
			me in the fear of Him, and make me a worthy servant of His goodness. 
			Amen.</p>

			<p>To you, my champion and commander, I your city, saved from disasters, 
			dedicate, O Mother of God, hymns of victory and thanksgiving, but as 
			you have unassailable might, deliver me from every kind of danger, that 
			I may cry to you:</p>

			<p>Hail, Bride without bridegroom!</p>

			<p>Most Holy Mother of God, save us.</p>

			<p>Virgin, Mother of God,</p>

			<p>Hail, Mary, full of grace,</p>

			<p>the Lord is with you.</p>

			<p>Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, 
			for you gave birth to the Saviour of our souls.

			<h1><a name="salutations"></a>The Salutations to the Most Holy Theotokos 
			(Akathist Hymn).</h1>

			<p>When the bodiless one learned the secret command, in haste he came 
			and stood before Joseph’s dwelling, and spoke unto the Maiden who knew 
			not wedlock: The One who hath bowed the Heavens by His decent is held 
			and contained unchanging wholly in thee. Seeing Him receiving the form 
			of a servant in thy womb, I stand in awe and cry to thee: Rejoice thou 
			Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p>To thee, the Champion Leader, we thy flock dedicate a feast of victory 
			and of thanksgiving, as ones rescued out of sufferings, O Theotokos. 
			But as thou art one with might which is invincible, from all dangers 
			that can be do thou deliver us, that we may cry to thee: Rejoice, thou 
			bride unwedded.</p>

			<p>An Angel, and the chiefest among them, was sent from heaven to cry: 
			Rejoice! To the Mother of God. And beholding Thee, O Lord, taking bodily 
			form, he stood in awe, and with his bodiless voice he cried aloud to 
			her such things as these:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom joy shall shine forth. Rejoice, thou through 
			whom the curse shall be blotted out.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou the Restoration of fallen Adam. Rejoice, thou the redemption 
			of the tears of Eve.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Height hard to climb for human thought. Rejoice, Depth hard 
			to explore, even for the eyes of Angels.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for thou art the Throne of the King. Rejoice, for thou sustainest 
			the Sustainer of all.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Star that causest the Sun to appear. Rejoice, womb of the 
			divine Incarnation.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom creation is renewed. Rejoice, thou through 
			whom the Creator becometh a babe.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p>Beholding herself in chastity, the holy one spoke boldly unto Gabriel: 
			The strangeness of thy words seemeth hard to my soul to receive, for 
			how speakest thou of a seedless conception? Crying aloud: Alleluia.</p>

			<p>Seeking to know knowledge unknown, the Virgin cried to him who ministered 
			unto her: From a chaste womb how can a Son be born? Tell thou me! Then 
			he spoke unto her in fear, yet crying aloud thus:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Initiate of the ineffable counsel. Rejoice, thou Faith 
			in that which demandeth silence.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Prelude of the miracles of Christ.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Pinnacle of His doctrines.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, heavenly Ladder whereby God came down. Rejoice, Bridge leading 
			those of earth to Heaven.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Marvel far-famed of Angels. Rejoice, Wounding much-bewailed 
			of demons.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who ineffably gavest birth to the Light. Rejoice, thou 
			who didst reveal the mystery to none.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who oversoarest the knowledge of the wise. Rejoice, 
			thou who enlightenest the minds of the faithful.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>The power of the Most High then overshadowed her who knew not wedlock, 
			that she might conceive, and showed forth her fruitful womb as a sweet 
			meadow to all who desire to reap salvation, whilst chanting:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Carrying God in her womb, the Virgin hastened to Elizabeth, whose 
			unborn babe straightway perceiving her salutation rejoiced, and with 
			leaps as it were with songs, he cried out to the Theotokos:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, vine bearing the unfading bloom. Rejoice, land yielding 
			the untainted Fruit.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who dost tend the caring Husbandman. Rejoice, thou 
			who dost blossom forth the Sower of our life.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Field bearing a bounty of compassions. Rejoice, Table laden 
			with an abundance of mercies.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for thou revivest the meadow of delight. Rejoice, for thou 
			preparest a haven for souls.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, acceptable Incense of intercession. Rejoice, Oblation for 
			all the world.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Favour of god to mortals. Rejoice, Access of mortals to 
			God.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou bride unwedded.</p>

			<p>Having a tempest of doubting thoughts within, the chaste Joseph was 
			troubled, for he suspected a secret union as he beheld thee unwed, O 
			blameless one, but when he learned of thy conception through the Holy 
			Spirit, he cried:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>On hearing the Angels praising the incarnate presence of Christ, 
			the shepherds hastened as to a Shepherd, and beholding Him as a spotless 
			lamb, pastured in Mary’s womb, her they hymned, and said:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Mother of the Lamb and Shepherd. Rejoice, Fold of the rational 
			sheep.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Protector against invisible foes. Rejoice, Opener of the 
			gates of Paradise.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for the things of Heaven rejoice with the earth. Rejoice 
			for the things of earth join chorus with the Heavens.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, never silent Voice of the Apostles. Rejoice, never-conquered 
			Courage of the Martyrs.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, firm Support of the Faith. Rejoice, shinning Token of grace.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom Hades was laid bare. Rejoice, thou through 
			whom we are clothed with glory.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Beholding the Godward-pointing star, the Wisemen followed in its 
			splendour, and holding it as a lantern, they sought thereby the mighty 
			King. And as they approached the unapproachable, they rejoiced and cried 
			to Him:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>The sons of the Chaldees beheld in the hands of the Virgin him who 
			by His hands fashioned man, and percieving Him as Master, though He 
			had taken the form of a servant, they hastened with gifts to do homage, 
			and they cried out to her who is blessed:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Mother of the never-setting Star. Rejoice, Dawn of the mystic 
			Day.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who Quenchest the fiery furnace of error. Rejoice thou 
			who</p>

			<p>enlightenest the initiates of the Trinity.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who didst cast down from power the inhuman tyrant. 
			Rejoice thou who didst show forth Christ, the man-befriending Lord.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who redeemest from the creeds of barbarism. Rejoice, 
			thou who dost rescue from the works of mire.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who makest the worship of fire to cease. Rejoice, thou 
			who makest the flame of the passions to be allayed.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Guide of the faithful to chastity. Rejoice, Rejoicing of 
			every generation.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>God-Bearing heralds did the Wise Men become, when they returned to 
			Babylon, and fulfilling Thy prophecy, they preached Thee to all as the 
			Christ, and they left herod as a trifler, who knew not how to chant:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Shining in Egypt the illumination of truth, thou didst dispel the 
			darkness of falsehood, and unable to bear Thy strength, O Saviour, her 
			idols fell, and they that were set free therefrom cried to the Theotokos:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Uplifting of men. Rejoice, Downfall of demons.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who hast trampled upon the delusions of error. Rejoice, 
			thou who hast censured the deceit of the idols.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Sea which drowned the noetic pharaoh. Rejoice, Rock which 
			refreshed those athirst for Life.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Pillar of fire, guilding those in darkness. Rejoice, Protection 
			of the world, more spacious than a cloud.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Sustenence, successor to manna. Rejoice, Minister of holy 
			joy.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Land of promise. Rejoice, thou from whence flow milk and 
			honey.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>When Symeon was near unto departing from this age of deception, thou 
			wast presented to him as a newborn Babe, but thou wast recognized by 
			him as perfect God. Wherefore, he marveled at Thine ineffable wisdom, 
			and cried out:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>New was the Creation which the Creator showed to us His creatures, 
			when He sprang forth from the seedless womb, and He preserved it incorrupt, 
			even as it was, that we, seeing this marvel, may praise her as we cry 
			out:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Flower of incorruption. Rejoice, Crown of continence.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who flashest forth the type of the Resurrection. Rejoice, 
			thou who showest forth the life of the Angels.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Tree of goodly Fruit whereby the faithful are nourished. 
			Rejoice, Wood of leafy branches whereby many are sheltered.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who bearest the Guide of those astray. Rejoice, thou 
			who engenderest the Redeemer of captives.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Supplication before the righteous Judge. Rejoice, Forgiveness 
			for many transgressors.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Robe of confidence for the naked. Rejoice, Tenderness vanquishing 
			all desire.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Seeing a strange childbirth, let us estrange ourselves from the world 
			by transporting our minds to Heaven: to this end the Most High God appeared 
			on earth a lowly man, that He might draw to the heights those who cry 
			to Him:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Wholly present with those below was the Uncircumscribed Word, yet 
			in no way absent from those above, for this was a divine condescension 
			and not a mere change of place, and His birth was from a Virgin chosen 
			of God, who heard such words as these:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Closure of the Uncontained God. Rejoice, Portal of the solemn 
			mystery.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, doubtful Rumour of the faithless. Rejoice, undoubted Boast 
			of the faithful.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, all holy Chariot of Him who rideth upon the Cherubim. Rejoice, 
			choicest Dwelling-place of Him who sitteth upon the Seraphim.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who makest things that differ to agree. Rejoice, thou 
			who yokest together motherhood and virginity.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom transgression is annulled. Rejoice, thou 
			through whom Paradise is opened.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Key of the Kingdom of Christ. Rejoice, Hope of eternal blessings.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>All Angel-kind was amazed by the great deed of Thine Incarnation, 
			for they saw the inaccessible God accessible to all, dwelling among 
			us and hearing from us all:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Orators most eloquent do we behold as fish before thee, O Theotokos, 
			for they are at a loss to explain how thou couldst remain a virgin and 
			yet give birth. But as for us, marveling at this mystery, we cry with 
			faith:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Vessel of the Wisdom of God. Rejoice, Treasury of His providence.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who showest forth philosophers fools. Rejoice, thou 
			who provest logicians illogical.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for the subtle disputants are confounded. Rejoice, For the 
			inventors of myths are faded away.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who dost draw us from the depths of ignorance. Rejoice, 
			thou who dost enlighten many with knowledge.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Raft for those who desire to be saved. Rejoice, Haven for 
			those who fare on the sea of life.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Wishing to save the world, to this end did the Ruler of all come 
			of His own will, and, though as God He is the Shepherd, for by this 
			likeness He called those of like kind, yet as God He doth hear:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>A Rampart art thou for virgins and all that have recourse to thee, 
			O Theotokos and Virgin, for the Maker of heaven and earth prepared thee, 
			O Immaculate One, and dwelt in thy womb, and taught all to cry out to 
			thee:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Pillar of virginity. Rejoice, gate of salvation.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Leader of spiritual restoration. Rejoice, Bestower of divine 
			goodness.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for thou didst regenerate those conceived in shame. Rejoice, 
			for thou didst admonish those despoiled in mind.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who dost bring to naught the corrupter of hearts. Rejoice, 
			thou who dost give birth to the Sower of chastity.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, bridal Chamber of a seedless marriage. Rejoice, thou who 
			dost join the faithful to the Lord.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, fair Nursing-Mother of virgins. Rejoice, bridal Escort of 
			holy souls.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Defeated is every hymn that striveth to pay homage to the multitude 
			of Thy many compassions, for even should we offer Thee, O holy King, 
			odes of praise numberless as the sands, we should still have done nothing 
			worthy of what Thou hast given unto us who cry to Thee:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>As a brilliant beacon-light shining to those in darkness do we behold 
			the holy Virgin, for she kindleth the supernal Light and leadeth all 
			to divine knowledge, she illumineth our minds with radience and is honoured 
			by these our cries:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Ray of the spiritual Sun. Rejoice, Beam of the innermost 
			Splendour.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Lightning, enlightening our souls. Rejoice, Thunder, striking 
			down the enemy.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for thou dost cause the manystarred Light to dawn. Rejoice, 
			for thou dost cause the ever-flowing River to gush forth.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou who dost depict the image of the font. Rejoice, thou 
			who dost wash away the stain of sin.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Laver purifying conscience. Rejoice, Wine- bowl pouring 
			forth joy.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, sweet-scented Fragrance of Christ. Rejoice, Life of mystic 
			festival.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Wishing to bestow His grace, He that forgiveth the ancient debts 
			of all men came of His own will to dwell among those who had departed 
			from His favour, and having rent asunder the handwriting against them, 
			He heareth from all:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Whilst hymning Thine Offspring, we all praise thee, O Theotokos as 
			a living temple, for the Lord, who holdeth all things in His hand, dwelt 
			in thy womb, and He hallowed and glorified thee, and taught all to cry 
			to thee:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Tabernacle of God the Word. Rejoice, Holy one, holier than 
			the Holies.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Ark made golden by the Spirit. Rejoice, inexhaustible Treasury 
			of Life.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, precious Diadem of godly kings. Rejoice, venerable Boast 
			of faithful priests.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, unshakable Tower of the Church. Rejoice, impregnable Bulwark 
			of the Kingdom.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom trophies are raised up. Rejoice, thou 
			through whom enemies are cast down.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Healing of my flesh. Rejoice, salvation of my soul.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>O All-Hymned Mother, who didst bear the Word (3 times). Who is more 
			holy than all the Saints, as thou recievest this our offering, rescue 
			us all from every calamity, and deliver from future torment those who 
			cry with one voice:</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Alleluia.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>An Angel, and the chiefest among them, was sent from Heaven to cry: 
			Rejoice! To the Mother of God. And beholding Thee, O Lord, taking bodily 
			form, he stood in awe, and with his bodiless voice, he cried out aloud 
			to thee such things as these:</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom joy shall shine forth. Rejoice, thou through 
			whom the curse shall be blotted out.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou the Restoration of the fallen Adam. Rejoice, thou the 
			redemption of the tears of Eve.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Height hard to climb for human thought. Rejoice, Depth hard 
			to explore even for the eyes of Angels.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, for thou art the Throne of a King. Rejoice, for thou sustainest 
			the Sustainer of all.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, Star that causest the Sun to appear. Rejoice, Womb of the 
			divine Incarnation.</p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou through whom creation is renewed. Rejoice, thou through 
			whom the Creator becometh a babe.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Rejoice, thou Bride unwedded.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>To Thee, the Champion Leader, we thy flock dedicate a feast of victory 
			and of thanksgiving, as ones rescued out of sufferings, o Theotokos. 
			But as thou art one with might which is invincible, from all dangers 
			that can be do thou deliver us, that we may cry to Thee:</p>

			<p>Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning, for in Thee have I put 
			my hope.</p>

			<p>Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk, for unto 
			Thee have I lifted up my soul.</p>

			<p>Rescue me from mine enemies, O Lord, unto Thee have I fled for refuge. 
			Teach me to do thy will, for Thou art my God.</p>

			<p>Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of uprightness, for Thy 
			Name’s sake, O Lord, shalt Thou quicken me.</p>

			<p>In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of affliction, 
			and in Thy mercy shalt Thou utterly destroy mine enemies.</p>

			<p>And Thou shalt cut off all them that afflict my souls, for I am Thy 
			servant.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>God is Lord, and he hath appeared unto us, blessed is He that cometh 
			in the Name of the Lord.</p>

			<p>O give thanks unto the Lord, and call upon His holy Name.</p>

			<p>God is Lord,(as above).</p>

			<p>All the nations compassed me round about, and by the Name of the 
			Lord I warded them off.</p>

			<p>God is Lord, (as above).</p>

			<p>This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.</p>

			<p>God is Lord, and he hath appeared unto us, blessed is he that cometh 
			in the Name of the Lord.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>To God’s Birthgiver let us run now most earnestly, we sinners all 
			and wretched ones, and fall prostrate in repentance, calling from the 
			depths of our souls, Lady, come unto our aid, have compassion upon us, 
			hasten thou, for we are lost in a throng of transgressions, turn not 
			thy servants away with empty hands, for thee alone do we have as our 
			only hope.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.</p>

			<p>(Troparion of your church,s named Saint is read here)</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Both now and forever unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>O Theotokos, we shall not cease from speaking of all thy mighty acts, 
			all we the unworthy ones, for if thou hadst not stood to intercede for 
			us, who would have delivered us from such numerous dangers? Who would 
			have preserved us all until now in true freedom? O Lady, we shall not 
			turn away from thee, for thou dost always save thy servants from all 
			manner of grief.</p>

			<p></p>

			<h2>Psalm 50(51)</h2>

			<p>Have mercy on me, O God, according to the Thy great mercy, and according 
			to the multitude of Thy compassion blot out my transgression.</p>

			<p>Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>

			<p>For I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.</p>

			<p>Against thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that 
			thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when thou are judged.</p>

			<p>For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother 
			bear me.</p>

			<p>For behold, Thou hast loved truth, the hidden and secret things of 
			Thy wisdom hast thou made manifest unto me.</p>

			<p>Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean, thou 
			shalt wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow.</p>

			<p>Thou shalt make me hear joy and gladness, the bones that be humbled, 
			they shall rejoice.</p>

			<p>Turn Thy face away from sin, and blot out mine iniquities</p>

			<p>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within 
			me.</p>

			<p>Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit 
			from me.</p>

			<p>Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing 
			Spirit establish me.</p>

			<p>I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn 
			back to Thee.</p>

			<p>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation, 
			my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.</p>

			<p>O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.</p>

			<p>For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it, with whole burnt 
			offerings Thou shalt not be pleased.</p>

			<p>A sacrifice to God is a broken spirit, a heart that is broken and 
			humbled God will not despise.</p>

			<p>Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Zion, and let the walls 
			of Jerusalem be built.</p>

			<p>Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with 
			oblation and whole burnt offerings.</p>

			<p>Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.</p>

			<p>Most Holy Mother of God, save us.</p>

			<h2>The Holy Gospel.<br>
			<i>(This is not said when a priest is not present.)<br>

			<p>In those days, Mary arose and went into the hill country with haste, 
			into a city of Judah, and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted 
			Elizabeth. And it came to pass that, when Elizabeth heard the salutation 
			of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with 
			the Holy Spirit. And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said,: Blessed 
			art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence 
			is this to me? For, behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into 
			mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. And blessed is she that 
			believed, for there shall be forfilment of those things which have been 
			spoken to her from the Lord. And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the 
			Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He hath looked 
			upon the lowliness of His handmaiden, for behold, from henceforth all 
			generations shall call me blessed. For the Mighty One hath done great 
			things to me, and holy is His Name. And Mary abode with her about three 
			months, and returned to her own house.</p>

			<p>Glory to Thee, O Lord, glory to Thee.</p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.<br>
			O Father, Word, and Spirit, the Trinity in Unity: blot out the multitude

			<p>Both now...</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>By the intercessions of the Theotokos, O Merciful One, blot out the

			<p></p>

			<p>Have mercy on me, O god, according to Thy great Mercy, and according 
			to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my trangression.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>O Entrust me not, I pray, to any human protection, O our Lady, holy 
			one, but do thou accept the prayer of thy supplicant. Sorrow hath fettered 
			me, and I am unable to endure and bear the demons’ darts, a shelter 
			have I not, neither place to run, I, the wretched one, embattled from 
			all sides am I, and no consolation have I but thee. Mistress of creation, 
			protection and hope of faithful ones: Turn not away when I pray to thee,

			Having willed thus, O Saviour, to dispense our salvation in Thine mankind,

			<p></p>

			<p>I t is truly meet to call thee blest, the Theotokos, the ever blessed

			we magnify.</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Higher than the heavens above art thou, and thou art much purer than

			<p></p>

			<p>From the great abundance of all my sins, ill am I in body, ailing

			<p></p>

			<p>Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy on us, for lacking as we are in

			<p></p>

			<p>Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.<br>
			</p>

			<p></p>

			<p>Lord, have mercy on us, for in Thee have we placed all our trust,
